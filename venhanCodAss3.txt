1. Can we create multiple one-crore objects in one class?

    Ans:-  Yes, Creating 1 crore objects for a class in Python is technically possible.
            but each object has memory, and creating such a large number of objects can lead to high memory usage and slow down the program. 


2. One class has two objects, and their two objects have one common method called the promote method. can we access the date of one object of the promote 
   method data in another object of the promote method?

   Ans :- 
 
          class Employee:
     		def __init__(s, data):
       		     s.data = data

    		def promote(s, other_obj):
               	    print(other_obj.data)

  	 obj1 = Employee("Object 1 Data")
	 obj2 = Employee("Object 2 Data")

	obj1.promote(obj2)

  NOTE: In Python, each object of a class maintains its own state and data. However, it is possible to access data from one object within the method of 
        another object under certain conditions.
